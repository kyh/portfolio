# Wildlife
In total there are less than 60 native fish species in the lake, but more than half of these are endemic.[19] The families Abyssocottidae (deep-water sculpins), Comephoridae (golomyankas or Baikal oilfish) and Cottocomephoridae (Baikal sculpins), and the subfamily Cottinae (part of the cottid family) are entirely restricted to the lake basin.
